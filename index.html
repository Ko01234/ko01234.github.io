				<p id="content">Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirate and the main protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives him rubbery attributes. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, a local runaway noble.[ch. 582–589]

Ten years later and still wearing Shanks' treasured straw hat, Luffy forms and commands his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as his rubber ability's fourth Gear from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.[ch. 590–602] Due to his infamy, he is one of the pirates who are known as "The Worst Generation". After the defeat of Kaido and Big Mom, he is subsequently named one of the newest members of the Four Emperors. Luffy Is also capable of using the advanced application for all types of Haki. Also, his devil fruit power awakened during the battle with Kaido, revealing its true nature as the Mythical Zoan-type, Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.
